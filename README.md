This is a repository to store all practice code for "Beginning C++ Programming - From Beginner to Beyond" by 
Dr Frank Mitropoulos from Nova Southeastern University, USA.

This is a journey of restarting my career as a full fledged and knowledgable C++ programmer after years of 
being a control engineer whose focus are divided between designing electrical schematic, PCB electronic circuit, 
program PLC using ladder diagram, program ROS using C++ & Python and program Arduino microcontrollers using Arduino IDE.
